To solve the inequality \( x^2 + 1 \geq 0 \), let's consider the following:

1. **Understand the expression**: \( x^2 \) is a square of any real number \( x \), which is always non-negative (i.e., \( x^2 \geq 0 \)).

2. **Add 1**: Since \( x^2 \geq 0 \), adding 1 results in \( x^2 + 1 \geq 1 \).

3. **Inequality Conclusion**: This inequality \( x^2 + 1 \geq 0 \) is always true for any real number \( x \) because the smallest value \( x^2 + 1 \) can take is 1.

Therefore, the solution is:

- **Solution**: All real numbers \(\mathbb{R}\).

The square of any real number added to 1 will always be greater than or equal to zero.
